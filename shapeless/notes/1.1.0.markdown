A minor release of [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
The main changes include,

* The addition of a Sized type for collections with statically known
  sizes.
  
* The beginning of a collection of non-test examples.

  fixed. Thanks to [aloiscochard](https://github.com/aloiscochard) for
  catching and patching this.

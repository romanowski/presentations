A minor release of [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless)
mainly focussed on replacing arity-specific boilerplate with SBT based
code generation.

* The boilerplate for HList <-> Tuple conversion type class instances is
  now generated and covers all arities.
  
* The boilerplate for ordinary function <-> HList function conversion
  type class instances is now generated and covers all arities.
  
* The boilerplate for tuple Typeable type class instances is now
  generated and covers all arities.
  
* Nat types and values are now generated.

* There is now a type- and value-level conversion from Nats to Int, and
  there has been some minor reorganization of the Nat type classes.

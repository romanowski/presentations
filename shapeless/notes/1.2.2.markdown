A minor release of [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
The main changes include,

* Scrap Your Boilerplate improvements
    * Data and DataT instances for any type with an associated HListIso,
      allowing any case class to be traversed/transformed with just the
      addition of a single one-line implicit declaration
    * Data and DataT instances for pairs generalized to arbitrary tuples
    * Added a SYB [example](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/shapeless/examples/sybclass.scala#L32) which also illustrates the gains from using HListIso

* Generalized toHList to anything viewable as a GenTraversable[_].

* Added HList toArray.

* Added infrastructure for lifting monomorphic functions to Poly1 and extending
  Poly1 domains to be universal.

* HList unify and toList now properly handle empty HLists.

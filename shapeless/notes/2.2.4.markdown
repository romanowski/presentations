This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.4][shapeless].

shapeless-2.2.4 is primarily a bugfix release, but includes two new
features (`Split1` and `WrappedOrphan`) to support type class derivation
for [Cats][cats]. Expect to hear a lot more about this shortly ...

These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.3.
shapeless 2.2.4 is source and binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.0+
and should be binary compatible with shapeless-2.1.0 in most cases.

* A `Split1` type class has been added allowing complex nested type
  constructors (ie. `F[G[...]]`) to be decomposed (ie. as `F[_]`,
  `G[_]`) despite the limitations imposed by [SI-2712](si-2712).

* An additional mechanism for managing the implicit priority of orphan
  type class instances (`WrappedOrphan`) has been added.

* A number of bugs relating to `Generic` instances for types with non-
  trivial dependent prefixes or inaccessible constructors have been
  fixed ([#369][issue-369], [#417][issue-417], [#418][issue-418],
  [#421][issue-421] and [#424][issue-424]).

* The `Witness` macro no longer attempts to produce singleton types for
  instances of values types ([#379][issue-379]).

* An interaction between [SI-5465][si-5465] and `Lazy` which caused
  generation of `Generic` instances of case-class-like types with an
  unapply method has been fixed ([#422][issue-422])

* shapeless master is now built with Scala 2.11.7.

* Scala.js has been bumped to 0.6.4 and shapeless builds for Scala.js
  and Scala 2.11.7 and 2.12.0-M1 are now being published.

Many thanks everyone who has contributed ideas, enthusiasm and
encouragement.

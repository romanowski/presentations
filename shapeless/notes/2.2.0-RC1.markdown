This is the first release candidate for [shapeless-2.2.0][shapeless]. 
These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.1.0.
shapeless 2.2.0 should be source and binary compatible with shapeless
2.1.0, and for migration from shapeless 2.0.0 the earlier
[migration guide from shapeless 2.0.0 to 2.1.0][migration] is still
applicable and is available on the [shapeless wiki][wiki].

This release includes a number of [bug fixes][fixes] and the following
new features and enhancements,

* Added support for derivation of type classes for higher-kinded types.
  See in particular the new [example][functor] illustrating the
  application of this to the automatic derivation of Functor type class
  instances for ADTs.

* Added support for Generic representation of types with repeated
  (ie. vararg) constructor arguments.

* Added a useful toString to instances of the Typeable type class.

* Added a useful toString to Sized containers.

* Improved the CSV serialization example.

* Reorganized the SBT project modules.
  The "shapeless-" prefix has been dropped from all the module names
  and it is now possible to drop into the Scala REPL with shapeless
  on the classpath using just the "console" command.

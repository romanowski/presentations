This is the final release of [shapeless-2.2.2][shapeless].

These release notes provide a summary of changes since shapeless 2.2.1.
shapeless 2.2.2 is source and binary compatible with shapeless 2.2.0+ and
should be binary compatible with shapeless-2.1.0 in most cases.

This is this is a binary compatability bugfix and compile time performance
release. The changes are,

* Binary compatability with shapeless-2.2.0, which was accidentally broken in
  shapeless-2.2.1, has been restored. MiMa has been added to the build to make
  this less likely in the future (thanks to Alexandre Archambault).

* Compile time performance of materialization of Generic instances for types
  with Coproduct representations has been significantly improved. Testing in
  the ensime-server project indicates that this gives compile time speedups of
  more than 10x for real world ADTs with a large fanout, making previously
  infeasible ADTs a realistic target for automatic type class derivation
  (thanks to Jason Zaugg and Sam Halliday).

A minor release of [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
The main changes include,

* Lars Hupel (@larsh) contributed the TypeClass type class and associated
  machinery in support of automatic derivation of instances of type classes
  from external libraries. The aim is to enable smoother interoperation between
  shapeless, Scalaz, Spire and other libraries which wish to collaborate.

* Brian McKenna (@puffnfresh) contributed a map method for the NatTRel type
  class, allowing natural transformations corresponding to the relationship
  witnessed by the type class to be mapped over HLists without requiring a
  function-specific Mapper instance.

* Tagged types are now encoded using a trait with a type argument rather than
  a structural type with a type member. The effect of this is that the
  companion object of the tagging type will now be included in the implicit
  scope of any implicit search for a type which embeds any type so tagged.
  Thanks to Ben Hutchison (@ben\_hutchison).

* Travis Brown (@travisbrown) contributed an example illustrating how to
  compute the cartesian product of two HLists.

* Ben James (@bmjames) contributed an example show how to derive an Ordering
  for an HList given Orderings for its elements and, given that, how to derive
  an Ordering for any case class with an in-scope Iso.
